The omnidirectional MPO-700 is the ideal base for high-end service robots. Its four Omni-Drive-Modules enable it to move extremely smoothly into any direction. This robot is even capable of rotating freely while driving to its destination. The Omni-Drive-Modules of the MPO-700 feature important benefits compared to other omnidirectional drive kinematics, like for example the MPO-500's Mecanum wheels.

Fully omnidirectional manoeuvrability
Very steady movements
High stability and payload
Compact, easily integrated drive units
This makes the MPO-700 a premium alternative for applications that require omnidirectional movements without the limitations of traditional kinematics.

How to Launch Basic Monte Carlo Position

Run "Roscore"

1. Open the map with launch neo_track2 
roslaunch neo_simulation neo_track2.launch 

2. Spawn the Robot 
roslaunch neo_simulation mpo_700_spawn.launch

3. Load the Map 
rosrun map_server map_server Neobotix/src/neo_simulation/maps/neo_track2.yaml
4. Run cob_scan_unifier <<< it can be done on the spawnfile 
roslaunch neo_simulation mpo_700_scan_unifier.launch 

5. Launch MonteCarlo simulation 
roslaunch neo_simulation mpo_700_amcl.launch

6. Launch RVIZ 
roslaunch neo_simulation mpo_700_rviz.launch
